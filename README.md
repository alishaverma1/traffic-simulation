# traffic-simulation
Design and build a Java program that simulates a four way traffic intersection. Each direction will maintain a list of vehicles waiting to cross. Each vehicle has a specific type, such as a car or truck. Only one pair of directions (N and S, or E and W) will be able to move at a time. Vehicles are removed from each list, as long as they have time to go. The light will change after a set amount of time, and then the other direction may go. If there are any vehicles remaining in the intersection after the light turns red, a new random vehicle is added to one of the directions. Emergency vehicles are given priority (moved to the front, and their direction is allowed to go). The simulation ends when there are no vehicles left.    You will print out the state of your intersection each time a light changes, or an emergency vehicle is given priority.
